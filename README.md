# Detection-and-Alert-of-Rainfall

The main goal of this project is to design and implement a rainfall detection and alert system based on Raspberry Pi and Water sensor technology which can be organized in industries and homes.

This project will help the people at house or other users to alert more quickly when it rains. The sensor is able to detect even the slightest water and will sound an alarm and turn on the LED light when exposed to rain. Which prevents wetting of cloths and other things which are put to dry.

# Components required

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Water sensor
3. LED
4. Buzzer
5. Ubidots
6. Connecting wires

# Working

1. Raspberry Pi is powered with 3v power supply which is the source for the system.
2. Water sensor is in ON state and the readings is taken to controller.
3. If the reading is HIGH (1) this indicates presence of water and the led and buzzer are activated along with the message is triggered to recipient.Hence as a result detection and alert regarding the rainfall can be monitored through Ubidots platform.
4. The mail will be triggered to the recipient indicating an early alert of rainfall.

# Applications

1. Rainfall detecting
2. Liquid leakage
3. Tank overflow detection
4. Weather forecasting
